# Conflict Analysis: Understanding Intent Before Resolution

## The Intent-First Approach

Before touching any conflict, answer:
1. What was main trying to accomplish?
2. What was our branch trying to accomplish?
3. Are both changes trying to solve the same problem?

Use `git log -p` on both sides to understand the WHY behind each change.
